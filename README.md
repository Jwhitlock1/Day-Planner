# Day-Planner
Plan your work day!
As an employee with a busy schedule I would like to add important events to a day planner to effectively manage time.
In this project I will capture user information via clicks, and local storage. In addition I will communicate with moment.js
to display the current date and time. 
The application displays time blocks for standard business hours
Each time block is color coded to indicate past, present, or future plans
Each save button stores the input to local storage to ensure that after the application is refreshed the scheduled appointment 
persists in the planner.
